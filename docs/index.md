## Connecting the Puget Sound, Regardless of the Grid.

**Puget Mesh** is a volunteer-led community dedicated to the deployment and support of off-grid communication networks—including **AREDN**, **MeshCore**, and **Meshtastic** across the Puget Sound region. Our mission is to provide community-owned resilient digital infrastructure that serves as a vital tool for disaster preparedness and emergency response.

**New to mesh networking?** You’ve come to the right place. Beyond the technology, we are a community of builders. Whether you’re looking to troubleshoot a node or brainstorm your next project, our Discord server is the hub for our off-mesh collaboration. Use it to ask for help and also to meet others in your area in one of the regional location channels.
</br>
</br>

**Get Involved:** Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/ANvUg3AyZt). We use it for nearly all of our communication outside the mesh.

**Follow Us:** We occasionally post user projects and events on both [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/pugetmesh.org) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/pugetmesh)

**Contact Us:** For official inquiries, please email [inquiries@pugetmesh.org](mailto:inquiries@pugetmesh.org).

## Current Events:

**Q1 2026**: Most of our efforts are going into building out MeshCore, the successor to Meshtastic. We have infrastructure for both, but MeshCore is much more effective in our region.
