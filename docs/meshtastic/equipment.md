# Meshtastic Equipment
The following sections detail our builds and installations around the area. Additionally you will find approximate coverage maps of each node. Use these to help get connected if you are inside the coverage (red) areas. 

### Build Tips:

- I find these ABS 5.9"x 3.9"x 2.8" enclosures (pictures below) are a good size, price, and build quality.
- Butyl tape works well to seal antennas (Don't block/cover any gaskets that your antenna mounts come with). This is very helpful for the gaps on the sides of N-Type through-panel mount connectors.
- I like to use TP4056 modules to charge the batteries. They do need a regulated input but allow for battery charging when the units are in storage (radio disconnected) and at faster rates than the rak wis-block solar connectors. I do usually desolder the charge LED for units with smaller solar panels.
- The 6 Watt "Camera" solar panels have a 5v regulated output. These also come with a mounting pole that is handy.
- I spray my antennas and enclosures with Krylon Clear Triple Glaze Coating spray. This protects the plastics from UV damage (somewhat) but also seals any small holes where the antenna passes through. 
- I used to install switches inside the enclosures but now I prefer using the battery connector as a switch. I still use external (waterproof) switches when the enclosure requires a tool to open it. The switch goes between the radio and all power sources.
- All enclosures include a weep hole on the bottom. This allows pressure equalization as well as somewhere for water to go.
- Vaseline on all enclosure gaskets. This prevents the gasket material from drying out so quickly, but also seals better.
- Clearly label power. It should be easy to walk someone through powering the unit down over the phone, or ideally intuitively for them. Also label the unit so it is clear what it is, and I like to include contact information inside.
- After trying several antenna types. I prefer the Alfa 5dbi Omni antennas. They are a good price point, they come with an N Type male connector which connects directly to through-mount antenna connectors. They are short, which is good for wind load and stresses on the case. They work well as a good wide-beam omnidirectional antenna for general purpose locations.
