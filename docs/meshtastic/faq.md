# FAQ

## New User Expectations
It is important to know that Meshtastic is under rapid development, and is not yet a *polished* product. There are bugs and quirks but that is part of the fun. If you have just turned on your Meshtastic device for the first time, get it in a good location (being next to a window can help) and let it run overnight. It takes time to see other nodes, and for other nodes to see you. Some users choose to share their position (GPS or fixed coordinates) which will appear on the maps. There are a few public maps available showing nodes (that choose to share their position) but we use [https://meshtastic.davekeogh.com/](https://meshtastic.davekeogh.com/).


## FAQ's

* **What firmware version should I flash my device with?**
    1. It is best to ask our Discord since this answer constantly changes, and not always forward/newer.
    1. There have been many times that the online firmware documentation does not include known issues.
* **Where can I find the QR code to join the local mesh?**
    1. We recommend not using QR codes for adding channels in Meshtastic. QR codes silently change other settings including the output power of your radio and hop count.
    1. These issues are problematic for many reasons so we have stopped recommending their use. See [Here](/meshtastic/config/#local-channels) for more info.
* **Should I use a ROUTER or CLIENT role?**
    1. Short answer: Almost always CLEINT.
    1. CLIENT nodes still contribute to the mesh, they will repeat messages they hear as long as they only hear the message once. 
    1. CLIENT_MUTE is a good choice if you have many nodes at home but only want one (the best positioned node) to contribute back to the mesh by repeating messages. 
    1. ROUTER and ROUTER_LATE nodes ALWAYS repeat every message they hear. This can be good unless there are multiple ROUTER mode nodes covering the same area.
* **I have determined that I need to use a ROUTER mode role. How can I be a responsible ROUTER node owner?**
    1. Double check that a ROUTER mode (ROUTER/ROUTER_LATE/etc) is indeed needed. Let the node run for a while (days) and see how many ROUTER mode nodes are in your node list. Consider that when making your decision.
    1. The worst thing a ROUTER mode node owner can do is set their node and forget it. Be available to others in the event that your node is causing problems.
    1. Share contact info in your long name, and/or check your node DM's, and/or consider joining the "Meshtastic Router Owners" channel on our Discord. 
    1. Always share the accurate position (including elevation) of your node. This helps others connect to it and also helps prevent multiple ROUTERS in the same area.
    1. Backup power. We want this mesh to be available when other forms of communication are down. Solar power + battery is best, but even just a battery when wall powered ensures the node will continue to run for a couple of weeks.
    1. Frequently check in with the community. As we continue to grow, we hope to gain access to better and better locations for ROUTER mode nodes. As this happens, we will likely need to transition older ROUTERS to something else.
* **What is LongFast and how is it different from LONG_FAST?**
    1. LongFast is the name of the default channel when using the LONG_FAST modem preset.
    1. LONG_FAST is a modem preset, along with MEDIUM_FAST, SHORT_FAST, and others. These are a collection of settings that tell the LoRa radio how to send and receive data over RF.
* **How do I know if I am connected to the mesh?**
    1. Seeing other nodes appear in your node list is a good indicator.
    1. Allow your node to run overnight and search for it (long name, short name, or either ID string) on the [webmap](https://meshtastic.davekeogh.com/).
    1. See if your LongFast messages are appearing on the "#LongFast" thread of the "mqtt-messages" channel on our Discord server. 
* **Why am I not getting any responses to my messages sent in LongFast or Direct Messages?**
    1. The mesh is (currently) a fairly quiet place. We do have a [weekly net](/meshtastic/#weekly-net). This doesn't mean that you are not connected.
    1. Check out our discord as received messages are automatically published there. Specifically Meshtastic > mqtt-messages > LongFast.
    1. Many nodes are unmonitored and just serve to connect the mesh. We encourage use of "ðŸ“µ" in the long name to indicate that your node will not respond to direct messages. 
* **I have manually added a channel but do not see any messages, and no one is hearing me.**
    1. Make sure the channel PSK and Name are correct. 
    1. Both need to be 100% correct for messages to exchange. This includes extra spaces at the end of either field.     
* **I am not seeing any other nodes on my list, even after running overnight.**
    1. Make sure your node is somewhere it can signal, near a window can be a good place.
    1. Ensure your region is set (Choose "US") on the settings tab of the app.
    1. Our primary mesh uses the default settings of LONG_FAST and slot 20, not in ham mode. 
    1. Check the steps listed under "How do I know if I am connected to the mesh?" above.
* **My node keeps rebooting, or having other apparent issues.**
    1. Try reflashing your node again, and then try older firmware versions. This may take several attempts.
* **I have everything configured correctly for <FEATURE> to work, but it does not. Why?**
    1. Meshtastic has a lot of hard-coded special cases that may prevent you from using it in the way you desire. These are difficult to capture any one place, so please engage with us on discord, or another help forum to learn more.
* **Where can I go to learn even more?**
    1. The Puget Sound Repeater Group holds [Educational Presentations](https://web.psrg.org/educational-presentations/), covering many topics including a [video recording of Adam's Meshtastic presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyhIoz4HR4s).
    1. In November 2024, [Ham Radio 2.0 (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YywOlirsOMA) interviewed Meshtastic Developers, and they shared some _Meshtastic_ insights.
