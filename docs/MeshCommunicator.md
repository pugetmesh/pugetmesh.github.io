# 📡 You’ve discovered a Puget Mesh - Mesh Node!

### **Important: Please leave this device in its current location.**
This device is a critical piece of a community-owned emergency communication network. It is not a camera, a tracking device, or a hazard.

---

## ❓ What is this device?
You have found a **LoRa Mesh Node**. This is a low-power, long-range radio relay that allows the community to send text-based messages without relying on cell towers, satellites, or the internet.

Think of it as a "digital neighborhood watch" for communications. This node is part of the **Puget Mesh** project, a volunteer-run initiative serving the Puget Sound region.

## 🛡️ Why is it here?
We place these nodes in strategic locations to ensure that during a power outage, storm, earthquake, or other disaster, our community remains connected. This network allows neighbors to:
* **Coordinate** emergency responses.
* **Check in** on loved ones when cell lines are down.
* **Relay** critical safety information across the region.

## 🛑 Why shouldn't I move it?
**Please do not move, open, or tamper with this device.** Its position is carefully calibrated to "talk" to other nodes miles away. Moving it even a few feet—or changing the direction of the antenna—can break a link in the communication chain, potentially disconnecting an entire neighborhood from the emergency backup.

## 🤝 How can I join?
This network is **open to the public**. You don't need a license to use it, and we encourage everyone to participate!

* **Get a Device:** You can build or buy your own portable node for a small cost and start messaging your neighbors.
* **Join the Conversation:** We use **Discord** for our community chat, troubleshooting, and project sharing. 
* **Learn More:** Visit our home page at [pugetmesh.org](https://pugetmesh.org).
