# About Puget Mesh

Puget Mesh is a volunteer-led community organization dedicated to building resilient, decentralized communication infrastructure across the **Puget Sound Basin**, extending through Washington State and into British Columbia.

We specialize in the deployment, education, and support of various mesh networking protocols, including **AREDN**, **MeshCore**, and **Meshtastic**. Our mission is to foster a robust network of citizen-owned infrastructure that remains operational when traditional systems fail, ensuring our region stays connected during emergencies and everyday life.

## Our Focus
Our members work on a variety of off-grid and "edge" communication technologies:

* **AREDN (Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network):** High-speed multimedia mesh for licensed operators.
* **Meshtastic & MeshCore:** Long-range, low-power text and data routing using LoRa technology.
* **Disaster Preparedness:** Providing tools and training for emergency communication (EmComm) and neighborhood resilience.

## Connect With Us
We are an open community of hobbyists, engineers, and emergency responders. Whether you are a seasoned "ham" or a newcomer curious about off-grid tech, there is a place for you here.
